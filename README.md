# Angular Drag and Drop

A demo project for creating easy drag and drop / sortable objects in Angular.

## Running the app

This demo was built with Angular CLI. All you need to do to run it is run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Requirements

Angular Drag and Drop relies on the HTML5 drag and drop attributes, so it cannot be implemented with earlier versions of HTML and it probably won't work with very old browsers.
